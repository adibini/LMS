# Database_Project
Create a library management system using Database

The Aim of the Library Management System is to provide a friendly environment to maintain details of books and library users or members. 
Library Management System is a general purpose project, which is basically updating the manual library system into an internet-based 
application so that the users can know the details of their accounts, availbility of books and maximaum limit for borrowing. 
The project has been tailored to solve the problems faced by the Librarian, Members &Students in a manual processing of the information.

Library Management System is especially useful for any educational institution where modications in the content can be done easily 
according to requirements. For instance, In a school or college, librarian usually perform their work manually in which large amount of 
time and human effort is wasted in retrieving information, handling of huge data, generation of reports, updation of data etc. 
These types of problems can be easily solved by the automation of existing library information.

The Project can be easily implemented under varios situations. We can add new features as and when we require, making reusability 
possible as there is flexibility in all modules. The language used for developing the project is Java as it is quite advantagous 
than other languages in terms of cross platform capabilities, performance, various libraries, cost and development process.
